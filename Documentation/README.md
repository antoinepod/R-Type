#### Add an entity

- Declare the entity in the `networks/objects` folder
- Inherit it from `Objects` like the example below:
```cpp
    namespace Network {
        class Bullet : public Object {
        public:
            Bullet();
            ~Bullet() override;
        };
}
```
- Include your Entity in Deserialization.hpp
```cpp
    #include "YourObject.hpp"
```
- Declare your entity and a function to update it in Game.hpp, example:
```cpp
void UpdateExplosion(const std::shared_ptr<sf::RenderWindow> & window, Network::Object & explosion);
```
- Set its assets in Game.cpp, example:
```cpp
    std::map<ExplosionType, sf::Sprite> _explosion;
    std::map<ExplosionType ,std::shared_ptr<sf::Texture>> _explosionTexture;
    std::map<ExplosionType ,sf::IntRect> _explosionRect;
    int _explosionTmp;
```
- Initialize the entity in the `Client/src/GameStatus/Game.cpp` file and define its behavior
```cpp
// Explosion assets initialization example
    _explosionRect[ExplosionType::MISSILE] = {0, 0, 16, 14};
    _explosionRect[ExplosionType::SMALL] = {0, 0, 32, 30};
    _explosionRect[ExplosionType::MEDIUM] = {0, 0, 32, 32};
```
